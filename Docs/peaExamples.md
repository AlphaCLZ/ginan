# Pea Config Examples

Example configurations for the different `pea` use-cases are included in the git repository in the `examples` directory.
These examples utilise a reference dataset from 2019, which demonstrate the majority of the features that are currently supported by Ginan.

For descriptions of the specifics of those examples, refer to the code documentation's [Pea.Configuration.Examples](codeDocs/Pea_8Configuration_8Examples.html) page.
